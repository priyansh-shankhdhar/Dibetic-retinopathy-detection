# Dibetic-retinopathy-detection
Imagine being able to detect blindness before it happened.

Millions of people suffer from diabetic retinopathy, the leading cause of blindness among working aged adults. Aravind Eye Hospital in India hopes to detect and prevent this disease among people living in rural areas where medical screening is difficult to conduct. Successful entries in this competition will improve the hospital’s ability to identify potential patients. Further, the solutions will be spread to other Ophthalmologists through the 4th Asia Pacific Tele-Ophthalmology Society (APTOS) Symposium

Currently, Aravind technicians travel to these rural areas to capture images and then rely on highly trained doctors to review the images and provide diagnosis. Their goal is to scale their efforts through technology; to gain the ability to automatically screen images for disease and provide information on how severe the condition may be.

You are provided with a large set of retina images taken using fundus photography under a variety of imaging conditions.

A clinician has rated each image for the severity of diabetic retinopathy on a scale of 0 to 4:

0 - No DR

1 - Mild

2 - Moderate

3 - Severe

4 - Proliferative DR

Like any real-world data set, you will encounter noise in both the images and labels. Images may contain artifacts, be out of focus, underexposed, or overexposed. The images were gathered from multiple clinics using a variety of cameras over an extended period of time, which will introduce further variation.

Files
In a synchronous Kernels-only competition, the files you can observe and download will be different than the private test set and sample submission. The files may have different ids, may be a different size, and may vary in other ways, depending on the problem. You should structure your code so that it returns predictions for the public test set images in the format specified by the public sample_submission.csv, but does not hard code aspects like the id or number of rows.
